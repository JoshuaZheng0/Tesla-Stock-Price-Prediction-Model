# Tesla-Stock-Price-Prediction-Model
A predictive model for Tesla stock prices using LSTM neural networks and RSI-based indicators. Built with Pandas, Numpy, and Keras, the model processes stock data and evaluates performance using R-squared, max error, and variance metrics. Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices with Matplotlib and refines through backtesting.
